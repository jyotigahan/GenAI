1. What is LLM In plain English

**LLM** stands for **Large Language Model**.

It's a type of computer program that has learned to understand and generate human language by reading a huge amount of text — like books, articles, websites, and more.

Think of it like a very advanced robot brain that can chat, answer questions, write stories, and even help with tasks involving language because it has seen and learned from so much text.

For example, ChatGPT is an LLM! It’s trained to predict what words come next, so it can have conversations that sound natural.

2. What is LLM In Technical term

In technical terms, an **LLM (Large Language Model)** is a **deep neural network**, typically based on the **Transformer architecture** (e.g., GPT, BERT variants), 
trained on massive text corpora to model the conditional probability distribution of sequences of tokens in natural language. It consists of:

* **Parameters:** Hundreds of millions to hundreds of billions of learned weights.
* **Architecture:** Multi-layer Transformer encoder-decoder or decoder-only stacks utilizing multi-head self-attention mechanisms.
* **Training Objective:** Usually trained with objectives like *autoregressive language modeling* (predict next token) or *masked language modeling* (predict missing tokens).
* **Tokenization:** Input text is converted into tokens (e.g., subword units via Byte Pair Encoding or SentencePiece).
* **Function:** Learns contextual embeddings and token dependencies to generate or understand human language with high fidelity.
* **Inference:** Given a prompt, the model outputs a probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next token, enabling text generation through sampling or beam search.

Overall, an LLM is a parameter-heavy Transformer-based probabilistic model that approximates the joint probability of language sequences, 
enabling various natural language processing tasks with high accuracy.


                 Different Architecture Follows in LLM

Summary: 

The Transformer architecture is by far the most widely used and dominant for LLMs today. 
In practice today: Nearly all state-of-the-art LLMs are based on Transformer architectures or their variants due to their superior performance and scalability.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) / LSTMs (older sequential models) -- was common before 2018 but largely replaced by Transformers for large-scale language modeling
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for sequences -- was common before 2018 but largely replaced by Transformers for large-scale language modeling
Memory-Augmented Networks (with external memory modules) -- are still mostly research or niche.
Sparse Transformers (efficient long-context models) --  are recent improvements for efficiency and scale.
Mixture of Experts (MoE) (scalable large models) --  are recent improvements for efficiency and scale.
Hybrid Architectures (combining different paradigms) -- are still mostly research or niche.

                 Transformer Architecture with Encoder + Decoder Model
 
Summary of Connection:
Encoder processes input tokens into rich contextual embeddings.
Decoder generates output tokens step-by-step.
At each decoder layer, the decoder attends to encoder outputs via the Encoder-Decoder Attention block, allowing it to incorporate input context into output generation.

Legend:
- The arrow from "Final Output" in Encoder feeds into the "Encoder-Decoder Attention" in Decoder.
- Encoder-Decoder Attention lets the decoder attend to the encoder's contextualized representations.
- Masked Multi-head Self-Attention in decoder prevents positions from attending to future tokens.




 
                                                        Transformer Encoder: Full Architecture Overview
 


What is the Transformer Encoder?

The Transformer Encoder is a stack of identical layers (usually 6–12), each containing:

Multi-head self-attention
Add & Norm (residual connection + layer normalization)
Position-wise feed-forward network
Add & Norm again

The encoder processes the entire input sequence in parallel, generating rich, contextualized embeddings for each token.
Input: Token Embeddings + Positional Encoding

|  - Token "design" query attends to tokens "new", "website"   |
|    and "user-friendly" to capture related context            |
|  - Attention Scores measure relationships between tokens
    (e.g., "love" attends "user-friendly", "design")

                                                        Transformer Decoder: Full Architecture Overview
 

Explanation of each component:
Embedding: Converts target token indices into dense vector representations.
Positional Encoding: Adds position information since Transformer has no recurrence or convolution.
Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention: Allows the decoder to attend to previous tokens in the output sequence but masks future tokens to prevent “cheating” during training.
Add & Norm: Residual connection plus layer normalization stabilizes and speeds up training.
Encoder-Decoder Attention: Enables the decoder to attend over the encoder’s output representations, integrating the source input context.
Feed Forward Network: Position-wise fully connected layer applied to each position independently.
Linear & Softmax: Final layer to generate probabilities over the target vocabulary for the next token prediction.
